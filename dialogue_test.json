["Then they didn't know.  And if they didn't know, we can't hit 'em for punitive damages. And punitive damages is where the money is.", "Jesus Christ, Ed -- you know, the more I work on this thing, the more I realize what a crock of shit this legal system is.  Here we got a company that poisoned a whole aquifer -- that built a pool for a town, then filled it with toxic water -- and <u>we're</u> the ones who've gotta bust our ass proving things?  That's just not right."]
["Calm down. You're not into anything. It was my problem, you offered no help. It's got nothing to do with your investigation.", "That's the problem! How can I find John G. when I don't know what's going on?! How did you get me into this?!"]
["Just what the doctor ordered.", "Looks like your old workshop back on 42nd Street."]
["No, baby!", "...honestly..."]
["How many times have you shocked him tonight?", "Fourteen. We finally got him a room upstairs. Should be up there in a couple of hours."]
["Mr. Hypnos - sir - I needed to talk to you -", "Wait a minute. Stu Miley, right? Boys and girls ...Mr. Stu Miley, in the <u>house</u>! <i></i> This is an <u>honor</u>. We see a lot of nightmares down here, but yours are like <u>caviar</u>, man. You da <u>shits</u>!!"]
["No, no! Just with her hands.", "You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people."]
["...I don't want that asshole near my money. I don't even want him in the bar.", "We get a lot of assholes in here, Marty."]
["Did I tell you we've expanded the search spectrum?  We're including several other possible magic frequencies -- not just the hydrogen line anymore.  I was trying to get inside their heads, y'know?  And I started thinking, what other constants are there in the Universe besides hydrogen, and then suddenly it was so obvious -- transcendantals, right?  So we've been trying variations of pi...", "You know why I'm here."]
["But how... how do you know my name?", "A little birdie told me.  Good day, Miss Daniels.  Madam."]
["Calls himself Dodd.", "What does he want?"]
["They couldn't be worse for the Buttles.", "Why don't you say, no system is perfect."]
["Twenty-four?  Not twenty-five?  Or twenty-three?", "Two minutes to get on Broadway. They're doing some roadwork around the bridge.  Eleven to get downtown.  Four to the Lower East Side.  Six to clear the roadwork.  One minute margin for error.  My math says twenty-four."]
["Shells?  Whatever for?", "You know - the old shell game."]
["I saw the woman whose son's body was delivered last night.", "And that's why you don't want to be a doctor, Fettes?"]
["Hey, Sig - can we talk to you?", "Nellie, get me long distance.  What is it?"]
["The days of magic are ending.  The world is changing.", "Aye -- yet one such as I who has wandered this world for nearly nine centuries can remember back to other days of change.  Days of Robin of the Hood and Arthur Pendragon.  They were real enough once, but they drifted into men's dreams and became legend - - as we shall do one day."]
["Well, what's the matter?", "I'm a little tired."]
["Right.", "I am actor, he is actor, although he is an actor stroke musician. I just noodle along, I'm not so good. He makes me look like a retard -- He smokes me. I don't mean he smokes me."]
["I'd nearly given up on you.  I was about to leave.  I do have other clients.", "Are you Juno, our case worker?"]
["He didn't know nothing. And nobody. Except her, from when they was at that place Baby Suggs was at.", "He knew Baby Suggs?"]
["I'm going to write a book about this expedition.  I'm going to call it 'The Snark Log.'", "The commander normally has first publication rights."]
["Good. You've both been working close to the front.", "Never this close."]
["You were saying how you couldn't initiate change yourself, so I figured I'd help you out.", "Jesus."]
["Main bus...", "Ready."]
["Yes, yes, but that's --", "My son will be all right. If he isn't, I'll have you killed."]
["Bummer, huh?  And Friday is suppose to be a kick-ass day.", "Yeah it is...the best day before the weekend."]
["Well, let's not exaggerate. I take pictures. You line up what you want in the viewfinder and click the shutter. No need to mess around with all that artisto crap.", "I'd like to see your pictures some day."]
["Stop rehearsing your column... Isn't it strange, Addison? I thought I'd be panic-stricken, want to run away or something. Instead, I can't wait for tonight to come. To come and go...", "Are you that sure of tomorrow?"]
["So what are you up to today, Miles?", "Just kickin' back, I guess. I don't know. Jack and I were supposed to go golfing."]
["And how is this helping? come on say, good-night to all your new friends and let's go home.", "I'm a whore!  Your bathrooms are filthy!"]
